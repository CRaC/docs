Have you ever wondered where all that useful code that we all rely on comes form? Have you ever wanted to build a primitive or library that would actually get used by other people? Have you ever wondered if, and when, it makes sense to do so? It is the speaker's opinion that most libraries are [initially] created by accident. And that while most will die young, there may be much to learn from the ones that survive, thrive, and becoming truly useful for others..
